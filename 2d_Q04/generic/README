Two-dimensional N=(2,2) supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory
Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, etc.

# Summary of files in this directory (ignoring symlinks to ../../4d_Q16/susy)
# 0) Files used by all executables
com_vanilla.c        -- Serial communications, selected by Makefile
com_mpi.c            -- Parallel communications, selected by Makefile
io_lat.c             -- I/O modified to handle five-link lattice
io_lat_utils.c       -- Lower-level utilities for lattice I/O
io_helpers.c         -- Higher-level interface for lattice I/O
make_lattice.c       -- Set up lattice, neighbors, etc.
gaugefix.c           -- Fix to Coulomb gauge, requiring even number of sites in all directions
layout_hyper_prime.c -- Handle the distribution of lattice sites across processors

# 1) Additional files used only by pfaffian target (susy_phase)
io_phase.c -- Primitive (for now) dump and load routines for checkpointing pfaffian computations
