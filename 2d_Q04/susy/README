# ------------------------------------------------------------------
Two-dimensional N=(2,2) supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory

# Actively maintained targets:
susy_hmc for evolution with accept/reject step
susy_meas for standard measurements on saved configurations
susy_hmc_meas for evolution along with standard measurements
susy_eig for eigenvalue measurements on saved configurations
susy_phase for pfaffian phase measurements on saved configurations

# Additional targets, not actively maintained or regularly tested
susy_phi for evolution without accept/reject step
susy_hmc_pg and susy_phi_pg for testing with gauge fields only (no fermions)
susy_spill for printing out configuration in format expected by serial C++ code

# Dependences:
LAPACK is now required for all targets
Eigenvalue measurements (susy_eig) require PRIMME (https://github.com/primme/primme) as well

# Defines for compilation:
-DPHI_ALGORITHM for the basic phi algorithm (REQUIRED)
-DHMC_ALGORITHM switches on the accept/reject step
-DCORR switches on the Konishi and SUGRA correlator calculation
-DSMEAR switches on optional smearing for measurements
-DWLOOP switches on the gauge-fixed Wilson loop calculation
-DBILIN switches on the fermion bilinear calculation
-DEIG switches on the PRIMME eigenvalue calculation
-DPUREGAUGE switches off the fermions (FOR TESTING)

# Gauge group and fermion rep:
NCOL and DIMF defined in ../include/susy.h
For now we fix U(NCOL) gauge group with DIMF=NCOL*NCOL for adjoint rep

# Boundary conditions for fermions:
Only supports periodic spatial boundary conditions (BCs) for now
Input parameter PBC = +/-1 chooses periodic or anti-periodic temporal BCs
