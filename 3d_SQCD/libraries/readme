fun_xy_functions contain binary operations between different types of functions:
  x,y can be n,t,a
  n - is take argument directly
  t - first take transpose
  a - adjoint representation (normal matrix)

fun_adjoint contains simple functions doing adjoints - e.g. computing adjoint of something and saving it

fun_o_function contain other functions where type of funmatrix is irrelevant
  e.g multiply by scalar or sum same type funmatrices.
