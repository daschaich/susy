This directory contains a SUSY LATTICE interface to an implementation of the Remez algorithm.
It is adapted from an interface written by Doug Toussaint (dated 5/10/06) based on ``test'' code by Kate Clark using alg_remez.C.
A more recent version of this code (to consult for information about the algorithm and implementation itself, including its current caveats and limitations) may be found at
https://github.com/maddyscientist/AlgRemez

This software requires GMP, the GNU Multiple Precision Library.
The Makefile may need to be modified to link against GMP.

The main program is in poly.C, and calls the function generateApprox in alg_remez.C.
As detailed by the inline documentation, poly.C calculates and prints rational approximations to the fourth- and eighth-root functions we need, divided into Nroot number of additional roots.

Compilation: Run `make`.  Only compile and run in serial.

Usage: poly < [params_in_file] > [params_rhmc_file]

Where params_in_file contains
  Nroot  MD_order  action_order  eval_min  eval_max precision
Example:
  2      15        15            0.0000001 1500     65
