Four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory
Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, etc.

# Summary of files in this directory
# 0) Files used by all executables
com_vanilla.c           -- Serial communications, selected by Makefile
com_mpi.c               -- Parallel communications, selected by Makefile
io_lat.c                -- I/O modified to handle five-link lattice
io_lat_utils.c          -- Lower-level utilities for lattice I/O
io_helpers.c            -- Higher-level interface for lattice I/O
make_lattice.c          -- Set up lattice, neighbors, etc.
nersc_cksum.c           -- Compute link trace sum for lattice I/O (cksum itself set to zero)
ranstuff.c              -- Random number stuff, both for serial and parallel running
gaugefix.c              -- Fix to Coulomb gauge, requiring even number of sites in all directions
remap_stdio_from_args.c -- For reading input parameters
layout_hyper_prime.c    -- Handle the distribution of lattice sites across processors

# 1) Additional files used only by pfaffian target (susy_phase)
io_phase.c -- Primitive (for now) dump and load routines for checkpointing pfaffian computations

# 2) Files not currently used, retained for potential future testing
restrict_fourier.c -- Fast Fourier transform (FFT) routine used with ploop_corr.c
