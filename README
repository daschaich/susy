SUSY LATTICE is parallel code for RHMC simulations of extended-supersymmetric Yang--Mills theories in two and four dimensions, including related measurements.
This package evolved from the MILC code, and supersedes the serial C++ code presented in arXiv:1108.1503.
Extension to additional theories is currently underway in development branches.
