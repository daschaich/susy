# ------------------------------------------------------------------
One-dimensional 16-supercharge Yang--Mills (BFSS/BMN) theories

# Actively maintained targets:
susy_hmc for evolution with accept/reject step
susy_eig for eigenvalue measurements on saved configurations
susy_phase for pfaffian phase measurements on saved configurations
susy_meas for standard measurements on saved configurations [placeholder]
susy_hmc_meas for evolution along with standard measurements [placeholder]

# Additional targets, not actively maintained or regularly tested
susy_phi for evolution without accept/reject step
susy_hmc_pg and susy_phi_pg for testing with gauge fields only (no fermions)

# Dependences:
LAPACK is required for all targets
Eigenvalue measurements (susy_eig) require PRIMME v1.2.2 (https://github.com/primme/primme) as well

# Defines for compilation:
-DPHI_ALGORITHM for the basic phi algorithm (REQUIRED)
-DHMC_ALGORITHM switches on the accept/reject step
-DEIG switches on the PRIMME eigenvalue calculation
-DPUREGAUGE switches off the fermions (FOR TESTING)

# Gauge group and fermion rep:
NCOL and DIMF defined in ../include/susy.h
For now we fix SU(NCOL) gauge group with DIMF=NCOL*NCOL-1 for adjoint rep

# Boundary conditions for fermions:
Only supports periodic spatial boundary conditions (BCs) for now
Input parameter PBC = +/-1 chooses periodic or anti-periodic temporal BCs
