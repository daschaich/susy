This directory provides a suite of tests for the SUSY LATTICE code to simulate one-dimensional 16-supercharge Yang--Mills (BFSS/BMN) theories

Reference input and output files are provided for the following compilation targets (which are described in ../susy/README):
susy_hmc
susy_meas
susy_hmc_meas
susy_eig
susy_phase

Every target may be tested for SU(N) gauge theory with N=2, 3 or 4 colors.  The gauge configurations loaded by each test are also provided.  The susy_phase target is tested with and without checkpointing.  For the susy_eig tests we just make sure the extremal eigenvalues are doubled, without trying to obtain the full degeneracies expected for these theories.

The scripts scalar/run_tests and mpi/run_tests automate the process of compiling, running and checking the given target for the given gauge group.  Each script must be run from its respective directory.  Given the two arguments
$ ./run_tests <N> <tag>
the script will compile the target susy_$tag for gauge group SU($N), run the susy_$tag executable using the appropriate input file in this directory, save the output to $tag.SU$N.out and check for differences between this output and the reference file $tag.SU$N.ref.

The $makefile and $run variables at the start of mpi/run_tests may need to be adjusted to run on a given system.

Alternately, if run_tests is run with no arguments it will test every target for every N=2, 3 and 4.  This should be pretty quick, just a few minutes to run and almost as long to compile.

Current limitations:
Only anti-periodic temporal boundary conditions for the fermions are tested.
Only a conservative (15-pole) rational approximation is tested.
