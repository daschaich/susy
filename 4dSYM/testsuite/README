This directory provides a suite of tests for the SUSY LATTICE code to simulate four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory.

Reference input and output files are provided for the following compilation targets (which are described in ../susy/README):
susy_hmc
susy_meas
susy_hmc_meas
susy_eig
susy_phase

Every target may be tested for U(N) gauge theory with N=2, 3 or 4 colors.  The gauge configurations loaded by each test are also provided.  The susy_phase target is tested with and without checkpointing.

The scripts scalar/run_tests and mpi/run_tests automate the process of compiling, running and checking the given target for the given gauge group.  Each script must be run from its respective directory.  Given the two arguments
$ ./run_tests <N> <tag>
the script will compile the target susy_$tag for gauge group U($N), run the susy_$tag executable using the appropriate input file in this directory, save the output to $tag.U$N.out and check for differences between this output and the reference file $tag.U$N.ref.

Currently the MPI tests are customized for the HEP-TH cluster at the University of Colorado.  Adjusting the $makefile and $run variables at the start of mpi/run_tests may suffice to adjust the tests for other systems.

Alternately, if run_tests is run with no arguments it will test every target for every N=2, 3 and 4.  This may take some time to complete!  Typical total serial runtimes are about 5 minutes for N=2, about 45 minutes for N=3 and about 7 hours for N=4, with pfaffian computations dominating costs for N=3 and 4.

Current limitations:
Only anti-periodic temporal boundary conditions for the fermions are tested.
Only the most conservative (15-pole) rational approximation is tested.
