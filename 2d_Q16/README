This directory of SUSY LATTICE contains parallel code for RHMC simulations of N=(8,8) supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory in two dimensions, including related measurements.

See susy/README for the real README!

Top-level directories mostly follow the MILC layout:
generic   -- Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, etc.
include   -- Header files for common procedures
libraries -- Single processor linear algebra routines
susy      -- RHMC and measurements

Dependences:
LAPACK is now required for all targets
Eigenvalue measurements require PRIMME as well
