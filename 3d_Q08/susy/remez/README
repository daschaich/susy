This directory contains a lattice N=4 SYM interface to an implementation of the
Remez algorithm.  It is based on an interface written by Doug Toussaint (dated
5/10/06) based on ``test'' code by Mike Clark, using Mike Clark's alg_remez.C.
A more recent version of this code may be found at
https://github.com/mikeaclark/AlgRemez
That's where you should go if you're interested in the algorithm and
implementation itself, including its current caveats and limitations.

This software requires GMP, the GNU Multiple Precision Library.  The Makefile
may need to be modified to link against GMP.

The main program is in poly.C, and calls the function generateApprox in
alg_remez.C.  As detailed by the inline documentation poly.C calculates and
prints rational approximations to the fourth and eighth root functions needed
by N=4 SYM, divided into Nroot number of additional roots.

Compilation: Run `make`.  Only compile and run in serial.

Usage: poly < [params_in_file] > [params_rhmc_file]

Where params_in_file contains
  Nroot  MD_order  action_order  eval_min  eval_max precision
Example:
  2      15        15            0.0000001 1500     65
